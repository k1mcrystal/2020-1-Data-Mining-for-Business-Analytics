# 2020-1-Data-Mining-for-Business-Analytics
I learned several data mining methods(ex. Naive Bayes, KNN, Decision Tree, Neural Nets, Association Rules) for business analytics.
I used R and Rapidminer for exercise, and also did two final projects using kaggle data.

### 1. R basics
- create a vector
- access elements of a vector
- vector operation
- handle several data types(numeric, character, factor, logical, date)
- handle several data structures(vector, data frame, matrix, array, list)
- handle missing data

### 2. Naive Bayes
- predict whether a passenger is survived or dead from the accident by using categorical(discrete) predictors
- use titanic data
- change all data types into factor
- train-valid split
- run naive bayes
- ROC curve, AUC, lift chart, confusion matrix

### 3. KNN
- classify the type of iris plant by using numerical(continuous) predictors
- use iris data
- train-valid split
- find best k and run KNN
- show confusion matrix
- report expected class of new data

### 4. Decision Tree
- classify competitive auctions from noncompetitive auctions by using predictors
- use e-commerce trading data
- train-valid split
- run decision tree
- parameter tunning (prunning)
- show confusion matrix
- get rules 

### 5. Neural Net
- predict if the client will subscribe (yes/no) a term deposit by using predictors
- use bank data
- train-valid split
- use 2 hidden layer with 3,2 nodes each
- show confusion matrix and accuracy

### 6. Association Rules
- build a model that will help in packaging and sequencing courses
- use course data
- generate frequent itemsets
- generate association rules and interpret the rules
