# 2020-1-Data-Mining-for-Business-Analytics
I learned several data mining methods(ex. Naive Bayes, KNN, Decision Tree, Neural Nets, Association Rules) for business analytics.
I used R and Rapidminer for exercise, and also did final project using kaggle data.

1. R basics
- create a vector
- access elements of a vector
- vector operation
- handle several data types(numeric, character, factor, logical, date)
- handle several data structures(vector, data frame, matrix, array, list)
- handle missing data

2. Naive Bayes
- classify dependent variable by using categorical(discrete) independent variables. 

3. KNN
- classify dependent variable by using numerical(continuous) independent variables. 
- train-test split
- find best k
- use knn model
- show confusion matrix
- report expected class of new data
